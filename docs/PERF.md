# Performance

## Budgets (starting guesses, replace with measured numbers)
| Item | Budget |
| :- | :- |
| Client frame rate | 60 fps on a mid-range laptop, integrated graphics acceptable |
| First load | game playable within 5 s on broadband, under 15 MB before the first match |
| Server tick | 30 Hz sim, 20 Hz snapshots (guess) |
| Rooms per server process | measure at M8 on the large tier with full bots, record here |
| Bandwidth per client | under 64 kbps |
| Map generation | under 3 s on small and medium, large number recorded here |
| Mech triangles, near LOD | 10k |
| Prop triangles | 300 to 2000 |
| Atlas | 2048 shared, 1024 per mech set |

## Measurements
Record each measurement with date, build, hardware, tier, bot count, and the number.

| Date | Hardware | Tier | Bots | Metric | Result |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |

### Map generation (2026-10-17, MacBook, Node 25, chunk set of 11 grey-box chunks)
Measured with `npx tsx scripts/measure-generation.ts`, 10 seeds per tier. Includes building the collision grid and navigation grid and checking the map.

| Tier | Seeds | Median ms | Worst ms | Boxes | Nav cells | Retries |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| small | 10 | 4 | 7 | 320 | 22500 | 0 |
| medium | 10 | 41 | 43 | 3205 | 250000 | 0 |
| large | 10 | 160 | 166 | 12451 | 1000000 | 0 |

Well inside the 3 s budget. A browser will be several times slower than Node, still fine. Not measured yet: drawing 12,000 boxes on a mid-range laptop (one instanced mesh per colour, no culling), and how fast the collision grid answers with bots shooting.

### Delay (2026-10-17, localhost, in the built in browser)
| What | Before | After |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Other mechs shown behind the truth | 100 ms fixed | about 69 ms, grows with jitter (cap 200) |
| Hit check rewind | 150 ms fixed | ping plus view delay, capped at 250 ms |
| Body turn behind the camera | up to 750 ms for a half turn | none |
| Dash | up to 200 ms after the press | on the press |

Ping read 14 ms in the browser pane, which includes the pane's own timing. Still to measure on a real connection.
